#UCF Web Resources

A compilation of resources for students and web designers at UCF.

Curated by John D. Jameson, and anyone else who wants to contribute.


##Why Does This Exist?

Everyone wants to learn, but it can be hard to figure out what is and isn't valuable on the web. Classes at UCF are great for getting our feet wet and learning new concepts, but as designers and developers, we're much better off learning from and practicing on the web itself.
