#UCF Web Resources

A compilation of resources for students and web designers at UCF.

Curated by John D. Jameson, and anyone else who wants to contribute.


##Why Does This Exist?

Classes at UCF are great for getting our feet wet and learning new concepts, but as designers and developers, we're much better off learning from and practicing on the web itself.
